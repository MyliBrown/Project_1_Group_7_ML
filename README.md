# Project_1_Group_7_ML
This repository contains the code and output files for our first machine learning project for the group of Myli Brown and Ethan Stout. It covers the basic machine learning algorithms: Perceptron, Adaline, Logistic Regression, and SVM. 

## How to use:
Our code can be accessed in the file "Group7_Project_1" and when connected to the data provided for the project, it will run all the way through, block by block. \
\
We also included the output files that the code generates in the repository. \
They are:\
Group_7_Perceptron_PredictedOutputs.csv\
Group_7_Adaline_PredictedOutputs.csv\
Group_7_LogisticRegression_PredictedOutputs.csv\
Group_7_SVM_PredictedOutputs.csv

*Note: In data preprocessing, we removed data with missing values because there was plenty of clean data. Therefore, our output files have 6005 predictions instead of 6513.*
